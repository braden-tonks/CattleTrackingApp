## Overview

The Cattle Tracking App was developed as part of our Capstone Project at Missouri State University (2025).  
Our goal is to provide small-scale farmers with a simple, modern solution for tracking livestock data, reducing manual paperwork, and improving herd management efficiency.
We also wanted to develop our skills and challenge ourselves in full stack development, also learning how to implement outside tools like NFC scanning into our app.
